<h3>For anyone struggling to come up with project ideas, you're welcome to use my projects as a source of inspiration. However, I strongly encourage you to build them from scratch yourself to maximize your learning. The real value is in the journey of creating something new, not in duplicating an existing project.</h3>

As a beginner in web development, Iâ€™ve found that the most significant obstacle is applying what I've learned to build real projects with HTML and CSS. It's a common challenge where theoretical knowledge feels disconnected from practical application.

To overcome this, I'm committing to a focused challenge: building 10-20 different projects. My aim is to solidify the fundamentals and ensure that every concept becomes second nature. I am a firm believer that project-based learning is the most powerful path to mastery.

If this resonates with you, I invite you to follow along and share your own progress. Together, we can turn this challenge into a triumph.
